## Model Providers

This template ships with [xAI](https://x.ai) `grok-2-1212` as the default chat model. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot&env=AUTH_SECRET&envDescription=Learn+more+about+how+to+get+the+API+Keys+for+the+application&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.example&demo-title=AI+Chatbot&demo-description=An+Open-Source+AI+Chatbot+Template+Built+With+Next.js+and+the+AI+SDK+by+Vercel.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.vercel.ai&products=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22ai%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22grok%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22xai%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22storage%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22neon%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22neon%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22storage%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22upstash-kv%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22upstash%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22blob%22%7D%5D)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Package Versions & Upgrade Notes

This project currently uses the following key package versions:

- **Next.js**: `15.3.0-canary.31` (canary version)
- **React**: `19.0.0-rc-45804af1-20241021` (release candidate)
- **Tailwind CSS**: `^3.4.1` (stable)
- **NextAuth.js**: `5.0.0-beta.25` (v5 beta)

### Known Upgrade Challenges

**Tailwind CSS v4 Migration Issues:**
- Attempted upgrade to Tailwind v4 (`^4.1.12`) resulted in PostCSS configuration conflicts
- v4 requires `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin and different CSS import syntax (`@import "tailwindcss"` vs `@tailwind` directives)
- Spacing utilities and `@apply` directive compatibility issues encountered
- **Recommendation**: Stay on Tailwind v3.4.x until v4 is more stable

**Next.js 15 + React 19 Compatibility:**
- Project uses Next.js canary with experimental features (PPR - Partial Pre-rendering)
- React 19 RC can cause peer dependency conflicts requiring `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
- Turbopack (`--turbo` flag) has stability issues with current CSS setup - disabled in dev script

**Package Manager Migration:**
- Project was originally configured for pnpm but successfully migrated to npm
- Mixed package manager states can cause module resolution issues
- Always clean `node_modules` and lock files when switching package managers

### Future Upgrade Path

When upgrading to newer versions:
1. Test Tailwind v4 compatibility in isolated branch first
2. Ensure React 19 stable release before upgrading from RC
3. Monitor Next.js 15 stable release and Turbopack improvements
4. Consider upgrading dependencies incrementally rather than all at once
