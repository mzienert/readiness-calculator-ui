## Problem Breakdown

### Primary Problem Theme

**Problem Statement:** 
La Plata County SMBs are interested in exploring AI technologies to enhance, optimize, and boost efficiency in their operations, but many do not know where to start.

**Context & Impact:**
- SMBs recognize AI potential but lack clear entry points
- No systematic framework for evaluating organizational AI readiness
- Risk of failed AI initiatives due to inadequate preparation
- Potential competitive disadvantage as AI adoption accelerates
- Resource constraints typical of SMBs compound the challenge

**Specific Pain Points:**
1. **Knowledge Gap**: Limited understanding of AI applications relevant to their business
2. **Resource Uncertainty**: Unclear about required investments (time, money, personnel)
3. **Technical Readiness**: Unknown organizational capacity for AI implementation
4. **Strategic Alignment**: Difficulty connecting AI initiatives to business objectives
5. **Risk Assessment**: Inability to evaluate potential ROI and implementation risks

### Secondary Problem Theme

**Problem Statement:**
The mixed demographic of La Plata County businesses creates a wide spectrum of technology readiness levels, from non-existent to emerging, with potentially few advanced users.

**Context & Impact:**
- Rural/small business mix creates diverse tech sophistication levels
- Assessment tools must accommodate wide capability range
- One-size-fits-all approaches will fail for this demographic
- Different starting points require personalized readiness pathways
- Limited local tech resources and expertise

**Technology Readiness Spectrum:**
1. **Non-existent**: Paper-based operations, minimal digital presence
2. **Basic**: Email, basic websites, simple accounting software
3. **Emerging**: Cloud services, CRM systems, e-commerce platforms
4. **Advanced**: Integrated systems, data analytics, automation tools

**Demographic Implications:**
- Service sector dominance (healthcare, retail, food service) with varying tech needs
- Government sector workers may have different tech exposure levels
- Rural location may limit access to high-speed internet and tech support
- Small business constraints limit dedicated IT resources
- Generational differences in tech adoption and comfort levels

## Proposed Solutions

### Part 1: The Calculator (Primary Deliverable)

**Solution Overview:**
The AI Readiness Calculator serves as the primary user-facing deliverable, providing SMBs with comprehensive assessment and personalized guidance for AI adoption.

#### Core Calculator Features

**Access Control & Rollout Strategy:**
- Self-serve registration system (already implemented)
- Authentication required before accessing chat interface (no unauthenticated access)
- Controlled access via URL distribution to selected users
- Initial cohort: 5 La Plata County SMBs
- Gradual expansion based on performance monitoring and cost control

**User Interface Integration:**
- Calculator operates within existing chat interface
- Minimal UI changes - leverages current chat framework
- AI integration already established via existing system

**Assessment Approach:**
- Hybrid conversational/structured approach
- Leverages existing system prompt framework (see **[System Prompt Framework](./SYSTEM_PROMPT.md)**)
- Natural chat interaction with structured elements when needed
- 6-category assessment: Market Strategy, Business Understanding, Workforce Acumen, Company Culture, Role of Technology, Data
- Dynamic weighting based on SMB qualifiers (employee count, revenue, business type)
- 5-tier AI strategy recommendations: Efficiency → Productivity → Effectiveness → Growth → Expert

#### Assessment Framework

**Multi-Agent Architecture Implementation**

```typescript
const assessmentOrchestrator = {
  agents: {
    qualifier: new QualifierAgent(),      // Handles employee count, revenue, business type
    assessor: new AssessmentAgent(),      // Manages 6-category questions 1-by-1  
    analyzer: new AnalysisAgent(),        // Post-processing scoring & strategy determination
    reporter: new ReportingAgent()        // Beautiful.ai integration
  }
}
```

**Agent Responsibilities:**

1. **QualifierAgent**: 
   - Collects SMB context (employee count, revenue band, business type)
   - Establishes dynamic weighting parameters
   - Sets conversation tone and expectations

2. **AssessmentAgent**:
   - Manages 6-category assessment flow (one question at a time)
   - Maintains conversation context and empathetic responses
   - Handles clarifications (e.g., "What's a KPI?")
   - Uses structured outputs for consistent data capture

3. **AnalysisAgent**:
   - Post-processing scoring with dynamic weighting applied
   - Strategy determination based on scoring matrices
   - Concern analysis and mitigation strategies
   - Roadmap generation (Phase 1, 2, 3)

4. **ReportingAgent**:
   - Beautiful.ai MCP integration for professional report generation
   - Modular section assembly (Executive Summary, Scoring, etc.)
   - Multiple format outputs (PDF, presentation, dashboard)

**Technical Showcase Elements:**
- AI SDK v5 multi-agent patterns with state management
- OpenAI Structured Outputs for consistent data capture
- Function Calling for real-time data insertion and analysis
- Stream Management for smooth conversational UX
- MCP Integration with Beautiful.ai for professional reporting
- Clean Architecture with proper separation of concerns

**Second-Pass Refinement Questions (For Future Consideration):**

*Agent Architecture:*
- Should the Assessor agent maintain conversation context, or should the Orchestrator handle state?
- How do we handle agent handoffs seamlessly in the user experience?
- What's the optimal way to share context between agents?

*Processing & Timing:*
- Trigger analysis after question 12, or allow early exit if patterns emerge?
- Should scoring happen incrementally or batch process at completion?
- How do we handle incomplete assessments or user drop-offs?

*Integration Patterns:*
- Generate Beautiful.ai reports server-side and return URLs, or client-side integration?
- Should we use background processing for report generation while showing immediate results?
- How do we handle Beautiful.ai API failures gracefully?

*Data Collection:*
- Insert anonymized data after each response, or batch at completion?
- Should insight collection run as background agent or triggered events?
- How do we balance real-time insights with privacy considerations?

*UX & Performance:*
- How do we maintain conversation flow during agent transitions?
- Should we preload next agent context for faster responses?
- How do we handle concurrent users with agent resource management?
