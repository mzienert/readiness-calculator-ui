## Problem Breakdown

### Primary Problem Theme

**Problem Statement:** 
La Plata County SMBs are interested in exploring AI technologies to enhance, optimize, and boost efficiency in their operations, but many do not know where to start.

**Context & Impact:**
- SMBs recognize AI potential but lack clear entry points
- No systematic framework for evaluating organizational AI readiness
- Risk of failed AI initiatives due to inadequate preparation
- Potential competitive disadvantage as AI adoption accelerates
- Resource constraints typical of SMBs compound the challenge

**Specific Pain Points:**
1. **Knowledge Gap**: Limited understanding of AI applications relevant to their business
2. **Resource Uncertainty**: Unclear about required investments (time, money, personnel)
3. **Technical Readiness**: Unknown organizational capacity for AI implementation
4. **Strategic Alignment**: Difficulty connecting AI initiatives to business objectives
5. **Risk Assessment**: Inability to evaluate potential ROI and implementation risks

### Secondary Problem Theme

**Problem Statement:**
The mixed demographic of La Plata County businesses creates a wide spectrum of technology readiness levels, from non-existent to emerging, with potentially few advanced users.

**Context & Impact:**
- Rural/small business mix creates diverse tech sophistication levels
- Assessment tools must accommodate wide capability range
- One-size-fits-all approaches will fail for this demographic
- Different starting points require personalized readiness pathways
- Limited local tech resources and expertise

**Technology Readiness Spectrum:**
1. **Non-existent**: Paper-based operations, minimal digital presence
2. **Basic**: Email, basic websites, simple accounting software
3. **Emerging**: Cloud services, CRM systems, e-commerce platforms
4. **Advanced**: Integrated systems, data analytics, automation tools

**Demographic Implications:**
- Service sector dominance (healthcare, retail, food service) with varying tech needs
- Government sector workers may have different tech exposure levels
- Rural location may limit access to high-speed internet and tech support
- Small business constraints limit dedicated IT resources
- Generational differences in tech adoption and comfort levels
