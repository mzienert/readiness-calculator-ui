#### Assessment Framework

**Multi-Agent Architecture Implementation**

*Reference: [AI SDK Multi-Agent Patterns](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling#multi-step-tool-usage) for implementation guidance*

```typescript
const assessmentOrchestrator = {
  agents: {
    qualifier: new QualifierAgent(),      // Handles employee count, revenue, business type
    assessor: new AssessmentAgent(),      // Manages 6-category questions 1-by-1  
    analyzer: new AnalysisAgent(),        // Post-processing scoring & strategy determination
    reporter: new ReportingAgent()        // Beautiful.ai integration
  }
}
```

**Agent Responsibilities:**

1. **QualifierAgent**: 
   - Collects SMB context (employee count, revenue band, business type)
   - Establishes dynamic weighting parameters
   - Sets conversation tone and expectations

2. **AssessmentAgent**:
   - Manages 6-category assessment flow (one question at a time)
   - Maintains conversation context and empathetic responses
   - Handles clarifications (e.g., "What's a KPI?")
   - Uses structured outputs for consistent data capture

3. **AnalysisAgent**:
   - Post-processing scoring with dynamic weighting applied
   - Strategy determination based on scoring matrices
   - Concern analysis and mitigation strategies
   - Roadmap generation (Phase 1, 2, 3)

4. **ReportingAgent**:
   - Beautiful.ai MCP integration for professional report generation
   - Modular section assembly (Executive Summary, Scoring, etc.)
   - Multiple format outputs (PDF, presentation, dashboard)

**Technical Showcase Elements:**
- AI SDK v5 multi-agent patterns with state management

- How do we handle agent handoffs seamlessly in the user experience?
- What's the optimal way to share context between agents?

*Processing & Timing:*
- Trigger analysis after question 12, or allow early exit if patterns emerge?
- Should scoring happen incrementally or batch process at completion?
- How do we handle incomplete assessments or user drop-offs?

*Integration Patterns:*
- Generate Beautiful.ai reports server-side and return URLs, or client-side integration?
- Should we use background processing for report generation while showing immediate results?
- How do we handle Beautiful.ai API failures gracefully?

*Data Collection:*
- Insert anonymized data after each response, or batch at completion?
- Should insight collection run as background agent or triggered events?
- How do we balance real-time insights with privacy considerations?

*UX & Performance:*
- How do we maintain conversation flow during agent transitions?
- Should we preload next agent context for faster responses?
- How do we handle concurrent users with agent resource management?

*Evaluation & Fine-tuning:*
- What synthetic SMB scenarios best represent La Plata County business diversity?
- How do we measure assessment accuracy - scoring consistency vs strategy alignment?
- Should we fine-tune Assessment Agent and Analysis Agent separately or together?
- What's the optimal transition point from manual evaluation to automated metrics?

### Part 2: Data Gathering (Secondary System)

**Solution Overview:**
The data gathering system operates behind the scenes to capture anonymized insights for market intelligence, pattern recognition, and strategic business development.

#### Data Collection Architecture

**Event-Driven System Design:**
```typescript
// Assessment data collection via hooks
interface AssessmentEvent {
  eventType: 'qualifier_complete' | 'question_answered' | 'assessment_complete' | 'report_generated';
  timestamp: Date;
  sessionId: string; // Anonymous session identifier
  data: AssessmentEventData;
}

// Hook integration points (timing adaptable based on student resource decision)
const dataCollectionHooks = {
  onQualifierComplete: (data) => emit('qualifier_complete', data),
  onQuestionAnswered: (data) => emit('question_answered', data),
  onAssessmentComplete: (data) => emit('assessment_complete', data),
  onReportGenerated: (data) => emit('report_generated', data)
};
```

**Collection Points:**
- Assessment responses (all categories and scores)
- Conversation patterns and drop-off points  
- Time spent on different questions/categories
- Common clarification requests and follow-ups
- Industry-specific response patterns
- Geographic/demographic correlations (anonymized)
- AI strategy recommendation outcomes

**Data Capture Strategy (Brainstorming Required):**
*Key decisions needed for implementation:*

- **Response Storage Format**: Raw responses vs structured data vs both?
  - Store complete conversational responses as strings?
  - Extract and store structured JSON data only?
  - Hybrid approach with both raw and normalized data?

- **Response Normalization**: How to standardize varied responses for aggregation?
  - Normalize responses into predefined buckets/categories?
  - Use AI-powered semantic analysis to group similar responses?
  - Manual categorization vs automated classification?

- **Data Processing Timing**: When to process and analyze responses?
  - Real-time processing during conversation (post-response)?
  - Batch processing after complete assessment (post-survey)?
  - Delayed processing for better anonymization?

- **Keyword Extraction**: Level of text analysis for insights?
  - Extract key phrases and terminology for trend analysis?
  - Full NLP processing for sentiment and theme detection?
  - Simple keyword matching vs advanced semantic analysis?

- **Aggregation Strategy**: How to group responses for meaningful insights?
  - By business size/revenue bands?
  - By industry sectors (health, retail, food service)?
  - By readiness levels and strategy recommendations?
  - Geographic clustering within La Plata County region?

*These decisions will impact database schema design, processing architecture, and analytical capabilities.*
