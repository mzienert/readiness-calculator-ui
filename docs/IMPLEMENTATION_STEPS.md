- ⏳ Create solid foundation for small-scale app without over-engineering

**Database & ORM:**
- ⏳ Implement proper usage of Drizzle ORM throughout application
- ⏳ Eliminate raw MySQL queries (avoid golden hammer scenario)
- ⏳ Set up proper staging and production database environments
- ⏳ Ensure proper database migration strategy between environments
- ⏳ Implement type-safe database operations using Drizzle schemas

**Assessment Design:**
- ⏳ Define assessment methodology and scoring system
- ⏳ Design user experience flow for diverse tech readiness levels (non-existent to advanced)
- ⏳ Specify reporting and recommendations output format
- ⏳ Create assessment framework for La Plata County SMB context

**Data & Analytics (Event-Driven System):**
- ⏳ **BRAINSTORMING SESSION REQUIRED**: Data capture strategy decisions
  - Response storage format (raw vs structured vs hybrid)
  - Response normalization approach for aggregation
  - Data processing timing (post-response vs post-survey)
  - Keyword extraction and text analysis level
  - Aggregation strategy for meaningful insights
- ⏳ Design event-driven data collection architecture with configurable hooks
- ⏳ Implement AssessmentEvent interface and data anonymization layer
- ⏳ Build privacy-first data capture system (no PII, no business identity)
- ⏳ Create event stream processing for real-time pattern detection
- ⏳ Implement batch analytics pipeline for trend analysis and reporting
- ⏳ Implement pre-anonymization removal window (session-based deletion before data anonymization)
- ⏳ Create internal business intelligence dashboard for insights

**Beautiful.ai Integration:**
- ⏳ Set up Beautiful.ai MCP server integration
- ⏳ Design report templates and formatting for assessment outputs
- ⏳ Implement error handling for Beautiful.ai API failures
- ⏳ Create fallback reporting mechanisms for when Beautiful.ai is unavailable

**Database Schema & Migration:**
- ⏳ Design anonymized data storage schema for event-driven collection
- ⏳ Create database tables for assessment events and analytics
- ⏳ Set up proper indexing for analytics queries and reporting
- ⏳ Implement database migration scripts for schema updates
- ⏳ Design data retention and anonymization processing tables

**Evaluation & Fine-Tuning (Post-Implementation):**
- ⏳ Design synthetic SMB assessment scenarios for comprehensive test coverage
- ⏳ Create evaluation framework for assessment accuracy (manual review initially)
- ⏳ Implement evaluation pipeline for scoring consistency and strategy recommendation alignment
- ⏳ Generate synthetic training data for La Plata County SMB profiles
- ⏳ Set up OpenAI fine-tuning pipeline for Assessment Agent (question asking, scoring consistency)
- ⏳ Set up OpenAI fine-tuning pipeline for Analysis Agent (strategy recommendations, roadmap generation)
- ⏳ Transition from manual evaluation to automated metrics as system matures
- ⏳ Integrate real anonymized assessment data for fine-tuning refinement

**Planning:**
- ⏳ Create development roadmap and milestone timeline

## Development Notes

### System Simplification Complete (2024-09-05)

**Major Refactoring Completed:**
- ✅ **Complete artifact system removal**: Eliminated entire document/artifact architecture including:
  - Database tables: `vote`, `document`, `suggestion` (removed from schema.ts)
  - API routes: `/api/document`, `/api/vote`, `/api/suggestions` (removed)
  - AI tools: `create-document`, `update-document`, `request-suggestions` (removed)
  - UI components: artifact viewers, editors, and related directories (removed)
- ✅ **Weather functionality removal**: Eliminated `getWeather` tool and all weather-related code
- ✅ **Voting system elimination**: Completely removed voting from all message components
- ✅ **UI simplification**: Replaced removed elements with inline component stubs:
  - Created inline replacements for `PromptInput`, `MessageActions`, `Conversation` components
  - Fixed all missing import errors with minimal inline implementations
  - Maintained existing functionality while removing complex dependencies

**Current Architecture:**
- **Clean streaming chat**: Pure AI SDK v5 streaming conversations without persistence complexity
- **Multi-agent ready**: System prepared for Qualifier → Assessor → Analyzer → Reporter workflow
- **Minimal dependencies**: Removed 200+ lines of complex artifact/document handling code
- **Type-safe**: All TypeScript errors resolved, simplified type definitions
- **Working state**: Application runs with clean streaming-only interface

**Files Simplified:**
- `lib/db/schema.ts` - Removed 3 database tables, kept core chat functionality
- `lib/db/queries.ts` - Removed document/voting functions, kept chat operations
- `lib/types.ts` - Simplified `ChatTools` to empty record type
- `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` - Removed tool configurations, pure streaming
- Components - Replaced complex UI with simple inline implementations

**System Ready For:**
- Multi-agent conversation implementation (Qualifier → Assessor → Analyzer → Reporter)
- OpenAI structured outputs for assessment data capture
- Beautiful.ai MCP integration for report generation
- La Plata County SMB readiness assessment workflows
