- ‚è≥ Create AnalysisAgent for post-processing scoring and strategy determination
- ‚è≥ Develop ReportingAgent with Beautiful.ai MCP integration
- ‚è≥ Implement Agent Orchestrator for seamless handoffs and state management
- ‚è≥ Set up OpenAI Structured Outputs for consistent data capture across agents
- ‚è≥ Implement Function Calling for real-time data insertion and analysis
- ‚è≥ Design Stream Management system for smooth conversational UX

**Infrastructure & Architecture:**
- ‚è≥ Upgrade to Vercel AI SDK v5
- ‚è≥ Remove Groq and Grok inference providers
- ‚è≥ Update inference provider to OpenAI
- ‚è≥ Implement proper staging/production environment separation (environment-based configuration)
- ‚è≥ Set up cost tracking and metrics separation between environments
- ‚è≥ Implement usage tracking at service level for AI API costs per user/assessment
- ‚è≥ Ensure telemetry is working properly for production environment
- ‚è≥ Refactor current lib structure to follow best practices for application design
- ‚è≥ Implement clean service boundaries (authentication, assessment, data analytics, AI inference)
- ‚è≥ Create solid foundation for small-scale app without over-engineering

**Database & ORM:**
- ‚è≥ Implement proper usage of Drizzle ORM throughout application
- ‚è≥ Eliminate raw MySQL queries (avoid golden hammer scenario)
- ‚è≥ Set up proper staging and production database environments
- ‚è≥ Ensure proper database migration strategy between environments
- ‚è≥ Implement type-safe database operations using Drizzle schemas

**Assessment Design:**
- ‚è≥ Define assessment methodology and scoring system
- ‚è≥ Design user experience flow for diverse tech readiness levels (non-existent to advanced)
- ‚è≥ Specify reporting and recommendations output format
- ‚è≥ Create assessment framework for La Plata County SMB context

**Data & Analytics (Event-Driven System):**
- ‚è≥ **BRAINSTORMING SESSION REQUIRED**: Data capture strategy decisions
  - Response storage format (raw vs structured vs hybrid)
  - Response normalization approach for aggregation
  - Data processing timing (post-response vs post-survey)
  - Keyword extraction and text analysis level
  - Aggregation strategy for meaningful insights
- ‚è≥ Design event-driven data collection architecture with configurable hooks
- ‚è≥ Implement AssessmentEvent interface and data anonymization layer
- ‚è≥ Build privacy-first data capture system (no PII, no business identity)
- ‚è≥ Create event stream processing for real-time pattern detection
- ‚è≥ Implement batch analytics pipeline for trend analysis and reporting
- ‚è≥ Implement pre-anonymization removal window (session-based deletion before data anonymization)
- ‚è≥ Create internal business intelligence dashboard for insights

**Beautiful.ai Integration:**
- ‚è≥ Set up Beautiful.ai MCP server integration
- ‚è≥ Design report templates and formatting for assessment outputs
- ‚è≥ Implement error handling for Beautiful.ai API failures
- ‚è≥ Create fallback reporting mechanisms for when Beautiful.ai is unavailable

**Database Schema & Migration:**
- ‚è≥ Design anonymized data storage schema for event-driven collection
- ‚è≥ Create database tables for assessment events and analytics
- ‚è≥ Set up proper indexing for analytics queries and reporting
- ‚è≥ Implement database migration scripts for schema updates
- ‚è≥ Design data retention and anonymization processing tables

**Planning:**
- ‚è≥ Create development roadmap and milestone timeline
