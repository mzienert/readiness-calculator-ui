# Implementation Steps & Action Items

## Purpose

This document tracks the specific implementation steps, action items, and development tasks for building the AI Readiness Calculator.

## Current Phase: Planning & Design

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Research La Plata County SMB demographics and characteristics
- ✅ Document primary problem theme in Problem Analysis
- ✅ Document secondary theme about mixed demographic tech readiness
- ✅ Define primary assessment objectives and outcomes
- ✅ Document data insights capture opportunity
- ✅ Define talent showcase and platform objectives
- ✅ Update problem analysis with current solution status

### In Progress
- 🔄 Review and integrate existing system prompt framework
- 🔄 Design calculator solution - primary deliverable
- 🔄 Design data gathering solution - secondary system

### Pending Tasks

**Technical Implementation:**
- ⏳ Remove unauthenticated access to chat UI (require authentication before accessing any chat functionality)
- ⏳ Implement controlled access rollout strategy (URL distribution to selected 5 SMBs initially)

**Multi-Agent Architecture Implementation:**
- ⏳ Define Zod/JSON schemas for agent responses and data validation
- ⏳ Design and implement QualifierAgent for SMB context collection
- ⏳ Build AssessmentAgent for 6-category question management (one-by-one flow)
- ⏳ Create AnalysisAgent for post-processing scoring and strategy determination
- ⏳ Develop ReportingAgent with Beautiful.ai MCP integration
- ⏳ Implement Agent Orchestrator for seamless handoffs and state management
- ⏳ Set up OpenAI Structured Outputs for consistent data capture across agents
- ⏳ Implement Function Calling for real-time data insertion and analysis
- ⏳ Design Stream Management system for smooth conversational UX

**Infrastructure & Architecture:**
- ⏳ Upgrade to Vercel AI SDK v5
- ⏳ Remove Groq and Grok inference providers
- ⏳ Update inference provider to OpenAI
- ⏳ Implement proper staging/production environment separation (environment-based configuration)
- ⏳ Set up cost tracking and metrics separation between environments
- ⏳ Implement usage tracking at service level for AI API costs per user/assessment
- ⏳ Ensure telemetry is working properly for production environment
- ⏳ Refactor current lib structure to follow best practices for application design
- ⏳ Implement clean service boundaries (authentication, assessment, data analytics, AI inference)
- ⏳ Create solid foundation for small-scale app without over-engineering

**Database & ORM:**
- ⏳ Implement proper usage of Drizzle ORM throughout application
- ⏳ Eliminate raw MySQL queries (avoid golden hammer scenario)
- ⏳ Set up proper staging and production database environments
- ⏳ Ensure proper database migration strategy between environments
- ⏳ Implement type-safe database operations using Drizzle schemas

**Assessment Design:**
- ⏳ Define assessment methodology and scoring system
- ⏳ Design user experience flow for diverse tech readiness levels (non-existent to advanced)
- ⏳ Specify reporting and recommendations output format
- ⏳ Create assessment framework for La Plata County SMB context

**Data & Analytics (Event-Driven System):**
- ⏳ **BRAINSTORMING SESSION REQUIRED**: Data capture strategy decisions
  - Response storage format (raw vs structured vs hybrid)
  - Response normalization approach for aggregation
  - Data processing timing (post-response vs post-survey)
  - Keyword extraction and text analysis level
  - Aggregation strategy for meaningful insights
- ⏳ Design event-driven data collection architecture with configurable hooks
- ⏳ Implement AssessmentEvent interface and data anonymization layer
- ⏳ Build privacy-first data capture system (no PII, no business identity)
- ⏳ Create event stream processing for real-time pattern detection
- ⏳ Implement batch analytics pipeline for trend analysis and reporting
- ⏳ Implement pre-anonymization removal window (session-based deletion before data anonymization)
- ⏳ Create internal business intelligence dashboard for insights

**Beautiful.ai Integration:**
- ⏳ Set up Beautiful.ai MCP server integration
- ⏳ Design report templates and formatting for assessment outputs
- ⏳ Implement error handling for Beautiful.ai API failures
- ⏳ Create fallback reporting mechanisms for when Beautiful.ai is unavailable

**Database Schema & Migration:**
- ⏳ Design anonymized data storage schema for event-driven collection
- ⏳ Create database tables for assessment events and analytics
- ⏳ Set up proper indexing for analytics queries and reporting
- ⏳ Implement database migration scripts for schema updates
- ⏳ Design data retention and anonymization processing tables

**Planning:**
- ⏳ Create development roadmap and milestone timeline
