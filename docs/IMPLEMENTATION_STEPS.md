  - Established `/api/agents/*` pattern for AI processing endpoints
- ‚úÖ **Client-Side Orchestrator**: Implemented Redux-based orchestrator with real-time UI updates
- ‚úÖ **Data Flow Optimization**: Clean separation between orchestration, AI processing, and persistence

**Architecture Benefits Achieved:**
- **Agent Independence**: Each agent can be developed and tested in isolation
- **Cost Visibility**: Clear separation between compute costs (agents) and storage costs (data)
- **Maintenance Friendly**: Changes to AI logic don't affect data operations
- **Scalability**: Individual agents can be optimized without affecting others

**Previous Simplification (2024-09-05):**
- ‚úÖ **Complete artifact system removal**: Eliminated document/artifact architecture
- ‚úÖ **Weather functionality removal**: Eliminated `getWeather` tool and weather code
- ‚úÖ **Voting system elimination**: Completely removed voting from message components
- ‚úÖ **UI simplification**: Replaced complex components with focused chat interface

**Current Architecture:**
- **Hybrid agent system**: QualifierAgent uses OpenAI Assistant, others use hand-rolled agents
- **OpenAI Assistant integration**: Native thread management with JSON structured responses
- **Pure data layer**: `/api/chat-history` handles only chat creation and message persistence
- **Client orchestration**: Redux-managed state with real-time UI feedback
- **Performance characteristics**: ~8-9 second response times with full context replay

**Files Implemented:**
- `app/(chat)/api/chat-history/route.ts` - Pure data persistence endpoint
- `hooks/use-orchestrated-chat.ts` - Orchestrator integration with clean API calls
- `components/sidebar-history.tsx` - Updated to use new chat-history endpoint
- Removed: `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` - Eliminated mixed-concerns endpoint

    "employee_count": "70",
    "revenue_band": "50k",
    "business_type": "sod farming",
    "location": "La Plata County"
  },
  "needs_more_info": true/false
}
```

- **Redux Integration**: Progressive updates to `assessor.collected_responses` with real-time state visibility

**Multi-Agent Handoff Flow:**
```typescript
// 1. Qualifier completes
{ qualifier: {employee_count: "5", business_type: "Marketing Agency", ...}, isComplete: true }

// 2. Orchestrator creates new thread for assessor
const newThread = await fetch('/api/threads', { method: 'POST' });

// 3. Assessor receives qualifier context + new thread
await fetch('/api/agents/assessor', {
  body: JSON.stringify({ messages, threadId: newThread.id, qualifier })
});

// 4. Assessor greets user with personalized context
"Hello! I understand you run a Marketing Agency in Durango, Colorado..."
```
