### Key Technical Components

1. **Client-Side Multi-Agent Conversation System**
   - QualifierAgent: SMB context collection (employee count, revenue, business type)
   - AssessmentAgent: 6-category question management with one-at-a-time flow
   - AnalysisAgent: Post-processing scoring with dynamic weighting and strategy determination
   - ReportingAgent: Beautiful.ai MCP integration for professional report generation
   - **Client-Side Agent Orchestrator**: Runs in React components with direct Redux integration for real-time UI updates and cost optimization

   **Alternative Architecture: OpenAI Assistants**
   - **Built-in conversation threading**: OpenAI Assistants automatically maintain conversation state through "threads" that preserve entire conversation history across multiple interactions, eliminating the need to re-send context
   - **Non-developer management**: Assistants can be configured and modified through OpenAI's dashboard, allowing non-developers to adjust prompts and instructions without requiring code deployments
   - **Structured outputs**: Native support for JSON-structured responses for consistent data processing
   - **Trade-offs**: 
     - Less control over execution flow - you submit requests and receive results without controlling intermediate steps, conditional logic, or custom error handling between processing stages
     - Additional API costs and latency
     - Dependency on OpenAI's service availability
     - Reduced ability to implement complex branching logic or step-by-step processing flows

   **OpenAI Assistants Threading Example**:
   ```javascript
   // Create thread and start assessment
   async function startAssessment() {
     const thread = await openai.beta.threads.create();
     
     // Initial qualifier questions
     const message = await openai.beta.threads.messages.create(thread.id, {
       role: "user",
       content: "I want to start a readiness assessment for my business"
     });
     
     const run = await openai.beta.threads.runs.create(thread.id, {
       assistant_id: "asst_qualifier_agent_id"
     });
     
     return { threadId: thread.id, runId: run.id };
   }

   // Continue conversation in same thread
   async function continueAssessment(threadId, userResponse) {
     // Add user response to existing thread
     await openai.beta.threads.messages.create(threadId, {
       role: "user", 
       content: userResponse
     });
     
     // Run assessment agent on same thread
     const run = await openai.beta.threads.runs.create(threadId, {
       assistant_id: "asst_assessment_agent_id"
     });
     
     // Thread automatically has full context:
     // - Previous qualifier responses
     // - Business size, revenue, industry
     // - All prior Q&A responses
     
     return run;
   }

   // Example flow
   const { threadId } = await startAssessment();

   // User: "We're a 5-person marketing agency"
   await continueAssessment(threadId, "We're a 5-person marketing agency");

   // User: "$500K annual revenue"  
   await continueAssessment(threadId, "$500K annual revenue");

   // Agent automatically knows company size + revenue for all subsequent questions
   await continueAssessment(threadId, "We struggle with lead generation");
   ```
   
   The thread preserves all context automatically - no manual state management needed.

2. **Hybrid Client-Side Architecture with AI SDK Integration**
   - **Real-Time Global State**: Client-side Redux store with immediate UI updates as orchestrator processes
   - **Orchestrator Slice**: Manages current session, agent transitions, UI state, and error handling in real-time
   - **Custom Hook Wrapper**: `useOrchestratedChat` combines AI SDK's `useChat` benefits with client-side orchestrator
   - **Typed Integration**: Full TypeScript support with custom hooks (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`)
   - **Cost Optimization**: Client-side state management reduces Vercel server compute costs
   - **Developer Experience**: Redux DevTools integration for state inspection and time-travel debugging
   - **Proven UI Patterns**: Leverages battle-tested `useChat` for message management, status handling, error states
   - **No Server Synchronization**: Avoids complex state syncing between client and server
   - **Database Integration**: Orchestrator calls dedicated API endpoints for async database operations
   
   **State Structure**:
   ```typescript
   interface OrchestratorState {
     currentSession: AgentState | null;    // Active assessment session
     isProcessing: boolean;                // Loading states for UI
     error: string | null;                 // Global error handling
     showProgress: boolean;                // UI preferences
     sidebarOpen: boolean;                 // Layout state
     recentSessions: string[];             // Session history
   }
   ```
   
   **Hybrid Hook Integration Pattern**:
   ```typescript
   // Custom hook combines useChat + client-side orchestrator
   export function useOrchestratedChat({ id, initialMessages, userId }) {
     const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
     const orchestrator = new AssessmentOrchestrator(dispatch, () => store.getState());
     
     // Use AI SDK's useChat for UI management
     const chat = useChat({ id, messages: initialMessages });
     
     // Override sendMessage to process through orchestrator
     const sendMessage = async (message) => {
       const result = await orchestrator.processMessage(coreMessages, userId);
       chat.setMessages([...messages, userMessage, assistantResponse]);
     };
     
     return { ...chat, sendMessage, status: isProcessing ? 'streaming' : 'ready' };
   }
   
   // Components get all useChat benefits + Redux integration
   export function Chat() {
     const { messages, sendMessage, status } = useOrchestratedChat({ id, initialMessages, userId });
     const currentPhase = useAppSelector(selectCurrentPhase); // Real-time Redux state
     
     return (
       <div>
         <Messages messages={messages} status={status} />
         <MultimodalInput sendMessage={sendMessage} status={status} />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

   - Configurable hooks for data capture timing (adaptable based on implementation preferences)
   - Real-time pattern detection and batch analytics for trend analysis
   - Privacy-first design with pre-anonymization removal window
   - Business intelligence dashboard for strategic insights

5. **Professional Report Generation**
