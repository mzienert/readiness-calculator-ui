### Key Technical Components

1. **Multi-Agent Conversation System with New Thread Architecture** *(Updated 2024-09-15)*

   - **QualifierAgent**: OpenAI Assistant (`asst_YpUQWu9pPY3PTNBH9ZVjV2mK`) for SMB context collection
   - **AssessmentAgent**: OpenAI Assistant (`asst_wmitwNMH5YwodUGXryvV1CuA`) for 6-category question management *(COMPLETED)*
   - **AnalysisAgent**: Post-processing scoring with dynamic weighting and strategy determination *(Pending)*
   - **ReportingAgent**: Beautiful.ai MCP integration for professional report generation *(Pending)*
   - **Client-Side Agent Orchestrator**: Runs in React components with direct Redux integration for real-time UI updates and cost optimization

   **OpenAI Assistants Implementation** *(QualifierAgent & AssessmentAgent - ACTIVE)*

   - **Built-in conversation threading**: OpenAI Assistants automatically maintain conversation state through "threads" for each agent's specific context
   - **Non-developer management**: Assistants can be configured and modified through OpenAI's dashboard, allowing non-developers to adjust prompts and instructions without requiring code deployments
   - **Structured outputs**: Native support for JSON-structured responses for consistent data processing
   - **New Thread Per Agent Architecture**: Each agent gets a fresh thread for clean separation and explicit context passing

   - **Current Implementation Details**:
     - **Performance**: ~6-7 second response times per agent
     - **Thread Strategy**: **New thread per agent** with explicit context passing for clean separation
     - **Thread Management**: Orchestrator creates new threads via `/api/threads` endpoint for each agent transition
     - **Database Integration**: ThreadId stored in Redux state, updated during agent handoffs
     - **Context Passing**: Qualifier data explicitly passed to AssessmentAgent for personalization
     - **Integration**: Seamless compatibility with existing orchestrator and streaming

   - **Benefits of New Thread Architecture**:
     - **Clean Separation**: Each agent starts fresh with only necessary context
     - **Cost Optimization**: No accumulated conversation history, smaller threads
     - **Error Recovery**: Agent failures don't corrupt other agents' contexts
     - **Explicit Context**: Clear what data each agent receives
     - **Independent Testing**: Can test individual agents in isolation
     - **Multi-Agent Showcase**: Clear demonstration of agent handoffs to users

   **New Thread Per Agent Architecture Example**:

   ```javascript
   // 1. Orchestrator creates initial thread for qualifier
   async function initializeNewSession(userId) {
     const response = await fetch('/api/threads', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
     });

     const { threadId } = await response.json();
     dispatch(initializeSession({ userId, threadId }));
   }

   // 2. Qualifier agent completes, orchestrator creates NEW thread for assessor
   if (qualifierResult.isComplete) {
     const threadResponse = await fetch('/api/threads', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
     });

     const { threadId: newThreadId } = await threadResponse.json();

     // Update state with new thread and agent transition
     dispatch(updateSessionState({
       currentAgent: 'assessor',
       phase: 'assessing',
       threadId: newThreadId
     }));
   }

   // 3. Assessor agent gets qualifier context explicitly (server-side)
   export async function POST(request) {
     const { messages, threadId, qualifier } = await request.json();

     // Always new thread for assessor
     const thread = { id: threadId };

     // Add qualifier context as initial message
     if (qualifier) {
       const qualifierContext = `BUSINESS CONTEXT from qualification:
${Object.entries(qualifier).map(([k,v]) => `- ${k}: ${v}`).join('\n')}

Start by greeting them and explaining you're the assessment specialist.`;

       await openai.beta.threads.messages.create(threadId, {
         role: 'user',
         content: qualifierContext
       });
     }

     // Add latest user message and run assistant
     const latestMessage = messages.filter(m => m.role === 'user').pop();
     await openai.beta.threads.messages.create(threadId, {
       role: 'user',
       content: latestMessage.content
     });
   }

   // 4. Example conversation flow with new thread per agent
   // Qualifier phase: thread_abc123
   // → User completes qualification
   // → Qualifier returns: { qualifier: {employee_count: "5", ...}, isComplete: true }

   // Agent transition: Orchestrator creates thread_def456 for assessor
   // → AssessorAgent gets thread_def456 + qualifier context
   // → AssessorAgent: "Hello! I understand you run a Marketing Agency in Durango..."

   // Assessment phase: thread_def456 (clean start with context)
   // → User: "I'm ready to start the assessment"
   // → AssessorAgent: "Great! Let's start with question 1a about market understanding..."
   ```

   **Key Benefits**:
   - **Performance**: ~6-7s response times per agent with optimized context
   - **Cost Optimization**: Minimal token usage with no conversation replay across agents
   - **Clean Separation**: Each agent starts fresh with only necessary context
   - **Multi-Agent Demo**: Clear handoffs showcase the agent system to users
   - **Error Recovery**: Agent failures isolated and don't affect other agents
   - **Independent Testing**: Can test and refine each agent in isolation

2. **Clean Architecture with Separated Concerns**

   - **Client-Side Orchestrator**: Coordinates agent API calls and manages Redux state transitions
   - **Agent API Endpoints**: Dedicated routes for each agent (`/api/agents/*`) with specific AI processing logic
   - **Data Persistence Layer**: Dedicated `/api/chat-history` endpoint for pure data operations
   - **Real-Time Global State**: Client-side Redux store with immediate UI updates as orchestrator processes
   - **Custom Hook Wrapper**: `useOrchestratedChat` combines AI SDK's `useChat` benefits with orchestrated flow
   - **Cost Optimization**: Client-side orchestration reduces server compute while agent APIs handle AI processing
   - **Developer Experience**: Redux DevTools integration for state inspection and time-travel debugging

   **Architecture Flow**:

   ```typescript
   // 1. User sends message → Client orchestrator
   const sendMessage = async (message) => {
     // 2. Orchestrator determines which agent to call
     const agentEndpoint = orchestrator.determineAgent(context);

     // 3. Call appropriate agent API
     const response = await fetch(`/api/agents/${agentEndpoint}`, {
       method: 'POST',
       body: JSON.stringify({ messages: context, userId })
     });

     // 4. Get agent response
     const agentResult = await response.json();

     // 5. Save conversation to database
     await fetch('/api/chat-history', {
       method: 'POST',
       body: JSON.stringify({
         chatId: id,
         messages: [userMessage, agentResult.message]
       })
     });

     // 6. Update UI state
     chat.setMessages([...messages, userMessage, agentResult.message]);
   };
   ```

   **State Structure**:

   ```typescript
   interface OrchestratorState {
     currentSession: AgentState | null; // Active assessment session
     isProcessing: boolean; // Loading states for UI
     error: string | null; // Global error handling
     showProgress: boolean; // UI preferences
     sidebarOpen: boolean; // Layout state
     recentSessions: string[]; // Session history
   }
   ```

   **Clean Separation Benefits**:
   - **Agent Logic**: Isolated in dedicated API routes, easy to refine/replace
   - **Data Operations**: Pure persistence logic separate from AI processing
   - **Orchestration**: Client-side coordination with real-time UI updates
   - **Scalability**: Each agent can be optimized independently
   - **Testing**: Clear boundaries enable focused unit testing

3. **SMB-Focused Assessment Framework with Flexible Schemas**

   - **6-category evaluation**: Market Strategy, Business Understanding, Workforce Acumen, Company Culture, Role of Technology, Data
   - **Dynamic weighting** based on business qualifiers (solopreneur vs small team adjustments)
   - **5-tier AI strategy progression** tailored for SMB constraints and capabilities
   - **Rural/small business terminology** and empathetic conversation design
   - **Flexible data collection**: Non-technical users can modify agent instructions and data schemas without code changes

   **Data Flow Architecture with Progressive Updates**:
   - **Qualifier**: Collects flexible `qualifier.collected_responses: { [key: string]: string }` with progressive Redux updates
   - **Assessor**: Collects flexible `assessor.collected_responses: { [key: string]: string }` with progressive Redux updates
   - **Analyzer**: Converts collected responses to structured `responses: AssessmentResponse[]` with scores
   - **Reporter**: Generates professional reports from structured data

   **Progressive State Management**:
   - **Real-time Updates**: Both qualifier and assessor update Redux state on every response
   - **Partial Data Visibility**: UI components can show progress and collected data in real-time
   - **Consistent Structure**: All agents follow same pattern with `collected_responses` and completion flags

4. **Advanced AI Integration**
